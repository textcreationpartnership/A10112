            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And wheras they argue, that therefore man hath free will to good, becauſe it is commaunded, they may make the ſame reaſon alſo, that man naturally without grace may fulfill the whole Lawe, in worke as well as in will, if he will.

                     </note> were to generall. The laſ that I haue ſeene, and the largeſt is Maiſter Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton, whom I quote often in the marge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The man I remember to haue bene of the Colledge, wherof my ſelfe am now. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whereof, and in Chriſtian charitie I wiſh him the beſt. And if Samuell may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake Elie,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.23</note> if the younger may warne the elder, to that end I haue thus called vppon him, and pulled him by the ſleeue, that he go not away in a ſleepe.</p>
                  <p>He knoweth Elie ſuffred his children to breake his owne necke. Verily the fancies and affections, that are bred in &amp; of man, if he cocker them vp, they will bring him to a worſe end then Elies was, or if he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect &amp; beat them lightly but with a fether, this will not amend the children of Belial, or the ſonnes of Adam.</p>
                  <p>Elie demaunded of his ſonnes, why did they ſuch &amp; ſuch things? Do no more my ſonnes, it is no good report, that I heare of you, which is, that you make the Lordes people to treſpaſſe: yet more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeaking roughly, he did not: but let them haue their ful fourth in ſinne: as if he had chidde them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6446:21"/>with his toung, and ſtroked them fayrely on the head with his hand. Wherfore God denounceth that he loued his children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue him, and therefore he woulde do a thing in Iſraell wherof whoſoeuer ſhould heare, his two eares ſhould tingle at it. So the Papiſt can not but confeſſe &amp; ſay: The iſſue &amp; ofſpring of nature corrupt, can not be but corrupt. As the mother ſinne is, ſo are the daughters of ſinne. Of a thiſtle a prick, of a bramble commeth a bryer. And namely as concupiſcence in the vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat man for ſome cauſes muſt needes be ſinne:<note place="margin">Stapl. lib. <hi>3</hi> cap. <hi>3</hi>
                     </note> ſo in the regenerate no good report there goeth of it, neither yet of mans wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome nor of his will.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſt can chide a little on this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, but yet the naturall man will honor his children, and make of him ſelfe more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his maker.

                     </note> which in order was touched before) albeit concupiſcence be euill and ſinne, yet is it not ſo properly, and in preciſe maner of ſpeaking, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe ſhe leadeth the way to ſinne, &amp; as it were cauſeth the Lordes people to tranſgreſſe.<note place="margin">Stap. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>5</hi>

                  <p>The Law is poſſible, and the Law is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, two contrary ſentences in ſound, and yet they both true in ſom ſence, as the two cherubins ſitting oppoſit ech to other yet both looking into the propitiatory: ſo

By the way if any aſke whether Moſes Lawe ſhall ſerue in the world to come, I am of opinion in ſubſtance, as of louing God aboue all things, and others as our ſelues, it ſhalbe the ſame, though not in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which muſt needes ſuffer alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with the change of the whole world. Then againe the Law is poſſible to be done, for it was done of Chriſt. And againe in ſome ſort it may be ſayd to be poſſible, and done of Chriſtians, for God deputeth all to be done, when he forgiueth all that is not do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e. But the Pelagian thought him ſelfe a trim man, when he could ſay as the Papiſt doth ſay, God doth not commaund impoſſible things. Yes (ſayth Auguſtine,) and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the end why, to hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble men, &amp; to teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the goodnes of the forgiuer, &amp; alſo their duty in crauing forgiueneſſe of the Lorde.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Auguſtine ſome where doth alſo in as expreſſe words as may be,<note place="margin">Auguſtine</note> auouch that the Lawe is poſſible. True. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it is woorth the laboure the while to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6446:51"/>obſerue in ſo learned a doctour ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine circumſtances, the better to attaine to the true meaning of his doctrine, that the bare name of ſuch a father cary no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away.

                     </note> as Auguſtine him ſelfe ſheweth full well in nombers of places.

For example. I can not loue mine enemies, ſayth one, I can not refraine my ſelfe from drinking, ſayth an other, I muſt needes be drunke, eſpecially when ſuch or ſuch a perſonage enforceth me: Auſtin replieth: <hi>Nolle in cul pa eſt noſtra,</hi>

All this is true. But one truth is not contrarie to an other. None ſhalbe iuſtified before grace. It is true. None ſhalbe iuſtified in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God, it is true to.

When euening came he gaue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one alike, &amp; then they which came firſt, and had borne the heat of the day, &amp; the burden of the whole labour, murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe of the inequality of their pay. One of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was anſwered, that he ſhould take his peny, wherefore he was hyred, &amp; if the houſholder would be more liberall to them that laboured leſſe, what was that to him, that wrought more and longer time, and yet perchaunce leſſe then of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie he ſhould, may not a man doe with his owne, which way he will? out of this M. Harding reaſoneth in ſence this: (I will ſpin his argument as far as it can run). The houſholder is God, the laborer is working in our vocation, the penny is life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:6446:60"/>the houſholder bid the murmuring laborer to be content with his hyre, and take that, which was his: then was it his: the price of his hyre is the penny for his labor, and the penny is life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, here is ſufficient proofe, for meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I trow,<note place="margin">

In proper wordes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out parable this is plaine, we ought to ſerue the Lorde withall our ſtrength, and powers both of body and ſoule, all the houres of the day, that is, all the dayes of our life, and when eeuening is come and our life ended, after all our labours in the vineyarde of the Churche mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, We haue done but the duty that we ought, and dew debt is no deſart: <hi>quae de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buimus facere,</hi>

                     </note> that though their are diuerſities in time of vocations, which is the chief ende of the parable, yet the reward ſtandeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon mercie, which gaue to the laſt as to the firſt. If all had gone by deſert, then the greateſt labourer, might duely haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the greateſt wages. But I pray you, are we hirelings? naye, we are ſonnes and heires: we looke not for a peny, as of hire, but yet we expect our penye, and that of meere gift, euen becauſe our God may do with his owne what him pleaſe: and he will in time beſtow it vppon vs his owne, euen for his Chriſtes ſake, in whome alone we onely truſt, and not in our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>O, this opinion will decay good workes meruelouſly, and greatly encreaſe either idlenes, or ſwarmes of euill liuers. Why? It was meruele then that Chriſt foreſawe not the inconueuience, when he gaue to the laſt as he gaue to the firſt. In deede if we be vagabondes, or lazy drones, or if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The difference then betwixt vs &amp; the aduerſaries ſtandeth on theſe points, both they and we worke, they to merit, we to ſhew our duty: they for hyre, we for loue, they as ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, we as ſonnes, they to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, &amp; we becauſe Chriſt hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for vs life euerlaſting, they worke and ſeeke glory in their works, we worke and glory only in Chriſt, they worke &amp; talk of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we worke, &amp; agnize our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in working.

                  <p>Again only faith (they ſay) excludeth the works of natur, as the vertues of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, &amp; in caſe of neceſſity wher time wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth onely faith is ſufficient, nether are externall
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:6446:64"/>works required, as of the theef on the cros. Farther, onely faith is oppoſed either to the misbeleef of heretiks, or vnto the vnbe lefe of infidels, likewiſe is it ſet vp againſt the pride of vaunting Phariſeis, &amp; alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fonde buſie curioſitie of vaine heades. In theſe ſences only, is only faith meant &amp; taken in the fathers. Well, if this were ſo, what of all this? for the firſt of all theſe laſt anſwers heaped vp together, be it agreed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that faith alone doth iuſtifie, without natures worke at all. For ſo vpon good occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out of the word of god, haue the fathers ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſo you ſeem to agnize that they haue. Wel then, be it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded as an euerlaſting truth, that in the caſe of iuſtifying, nature hath not to do at all. And will you graunt this? no not ſo, &amp; why not ſo? becauſe (as you dream) faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone doth iuſtify, is as much to ſay, as natur doth not iuſtify without faith, but with faith it doth. This was the former ſtarting hole: where faith alon was faith &amp; the law, &amp; here faith alone is faith &amp; nature. Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is not faith alone, but ſport alone for Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but to vs that morn &amp; thirſt for your ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what a ſinguler grief is it to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that beare the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:6446:64"/>will needes be thus wilfully decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, dauncing &amp; ſkipping vp &amp; downe in the netts of their own deuiſing, &amp; thinke no man diſcerneth. The fathers intend by this worde <hi>onely faith</hi> to exclude both the Law of Moſes and the Law of nature. But they conclude all together, &amp; include the workes of the one and the other within faith. Call ye me this excluding? then to go on with the reſt, you ſay when ſome of the Fathers by onely faith exclude, pride, infidelitie, hereſie, and curioſitie, you may as well ſay, <hi>verum eſt,</hi> without faith: &amp; yet notwithſtanding conioyne them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faith and infidelitie, faith and pride, faith and hereſie, faith and curioſitie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp (as it were) a Daniels image of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.33</note> that can not poſſibly cleaue or hang together. But if excluding be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, you may ſay and conclude what you will, and diſtinguiſh at pleaſure, and defend with eaſe, and all is well, ſpeciallie if you get but fauourable readers, that can and will thinke what ſoeuer cometh from beyond ſeas muſt needes go for good. Not withſtanding that the ſimple may ſee the childiſh fondneſſe, and the extreame falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this ſo abſurd dealing, I will ſhew it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:6446:65"/>then in the like reaſon: I would haue a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made onely of cloath, meaning by onely cloath to exclude ſtitching, lacing, &amp; facing with ſilk: ſhall the Taylor come, &amp; ſtitch, lace and face my garment, &amp; face me out, that when I willed it to be made of cloth alone, that without cloth forſooth, I wold not haue it ſtitcht, laced &amp; faced: but with cloth I would. Verily it had need be a very brode cloth, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> couer ouer al this follie, it is ſo brode: and a verie cunning, not a Taylor but a Rhetorician, or rather a Magician that muſt perſwade me ſo, and ſo bewitch a man againſt all ſenſe &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world.</p>
                  <p>As for the theef, that was ſaued by faith alone without externall workes alleadged by the Fathers, that doth verie well proue that faith alone in ſauing doeth the deede,<note place="margin">Ambroſ. in Rom. <hi>3</hi>
                     </note> and not workes. For the way to heauen is but ſingle, and one &amp; the ſame to all. The thiefe was ſaued and entered Paradiſe by faith onely: therefore alſo muſt all ſo do, if they will enter. For God will not ſaue ſome by him ſelfe in mercie, and ſaue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by them ſelues, partlie in mercie, and partlie by their owne workes. If the thiefe had liued longer time he ſhould &amp; would
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:6446:65"/>haue liued well: but his beleeuing was the wing that caried him vp, and the key that opened the doore of heauen. When time wanteth not, onely faith excludeth not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther workes or the goodneſſe of woorkes in earth, but the meritoriouſe deſeruing by workes with God in heauen, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both in heauen and in earth the free mercie and grace of God is beleeued, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and gloriouſlie ſet foorth, by this moſt excellent confeſſion of onely faith, whereby we agnize the gift, the free gift of God according to his purpoſe, promis, fauour, grace, and mere mercie.</p>
                  <p>In the ſtorie of the Goſpell in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, by examples thus much is prooued, and where onely faith is named, exacted, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended euen in bodily cares, much more in ghoſtly cauſes of the ſoule, where our Sauiour doth not ſo much reſpect the teares of ſome, or in others their feare and trembling, nor their crying &amp; calling after him, but their faith, and the greatneſſe of their faith.<note place="margin">

O M. Allen, and M.

                  <p>Wherefore when this former ſhift ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not the turne, you added, though <hi>onely fayth</hi> be requiſite and nothing elſe, yet that concerned the healing of the body, &amp; not the ſauing of the ſoule.

For Chriſt Ieſus the Sauiour both of bodie &amp; ſoule, moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally ſaueth the moſt principall part, &amp; therefore to ſhew what, &amp; how alone he worketh ſpecially in recuring their ſoules diſeaſed with ſinne, view thoſe miraculous cures done ſo euidently vpon their bodies.

But therefore ſhe loued, not that the dignity of her loue was precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the pardon of her ſins, but hauing receiued fauour &amp; pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly her dutiful loue enſued therupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <p>The faireſt argument of all other to the ſhewe is a concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that S. Iames maketh: and at the firſt ſight, woulde make a man thinke, greatly making againſt the doctrin of onely faith, where he ſayth: <hi>ye ſee then how a man is iuſtified of workes &amp; not of faith onely.</hi> wheras notwithſtanding S. Paule e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie where inculcateth nothing more then faith without workes. Doubtles theſe noble Apoſtles are not contrarie the one to the other: neither are the Scripturs as a houſe deuided in it ſelfe. God forbid they ſhould.</p>
                  <p>S. Paule teaching that we are ſaued by grace, and therefore not by workes, yet for
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:6446:68"/>that there were certaine vaine perſons crept in among them, he exhorteth withal that they ſhould not receaue the grace of God in vaine. Likwiſe, when he had ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, that life euerlaſting was the gift of God, and therefore no purchaſe of works, yet withall alſo he warneth them, that they beware alſo howe they tourne the grace of God into wantonneſſe. As Sainct Paule is vehement in this caſe, ſo vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſion S. Iames was moſt worthelie as earneſt as Sainct Paule.</p>
                  <p>For whileſt ſome heard that faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes did iuſtifie (vnſtable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned minded men, as they were) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting that Scripture, as alſo, other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their owne damnation, they bade adieu to all good deedes, ſaying in theyr fooliſh hearts, if faith without workes can ſaue, we can beleeue, that there is a God: &amp; if onely faith will ſerue, we can beleeue, and what neede more? And thus conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in a generalitie of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith, falſlie ſo called, litle recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was made, how bad ſoeuer their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation were.</p>
                  <p>For remedie whereof S. Iames aſketh, what ſuch a faith could auaile them? for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:6446:69"/>it was no faith and ſo nothing worth: or a deuils faith, &amp; ſo worſe then nothing. Yet leſt any imagin that S. Iames plainly &amp; ſimply graunteth a deuils faith to be faith, mark further how he doth not. For when he ſpeaketh of faith in deede, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the firſt chapter, he ſaith it is no waue that is to ſay, no trembling leafe, no ſhiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring reede, fully in S. Paules meaning that it is an euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t probatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; a certain, ſtable, grounded, ſtrong thing. Wherfore S. Iames whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he likeneth this ſuppoſed faith to the quaking faith of deuilles, he ſpeaketh not properly but by compariſon, and meaneth an other matter, then either himſelfe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of in his firſt chapter, or elſe S. Paule elſewhere in his Epiſtles. For properly he tearmeth this maner of faith a dead faith, that is, no faith at al. And this he proueth by aſimilitude: that as a man may argue that a bodie is not quicke but dead, without the ſpirit, that is, without all ſpirituall motions, life &amp; ſence, ſo is faith without works. For faith appeareth quicke and liuely in her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations and working. Yet not, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt dreameth, that works are the ſoule of faith, but I ſay as the ſpirit and vital breath of faith,<note place="margin">

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:6446:69"/>deliteth, and manifeſtly ſheweth it ſelfe. For if a man be a faithfull man, verilie alſo that man will liue vprightly, &amp; walk hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly, and do workes worthy of his faith, not that faith is made of works, but that where faith goeth before, works euer folow after. In ſo much that a man may well conclude, a faithful man, ergo fruitfull, a fruteles ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ergo faithles. Thou wilt ſay, thou haſt faith. that is a verball faith, &amp; nothing els. Faith is not made of words, but ſhewed in deeds. As the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne is not without his beames, no more is faith without her bright ſhining woorkes. Yet the Sunne is not made of beames: no more is faith of workes. Yet may I well argue thus. If it haue no beams, it is no Sunne, and ſo faith, if it haue no workes, well it may be called faith of vain men, in truth it is not. For the Chriſtian fayth of ſaued men, <hi>worketh</hi> euer in time conuenient by <hi>charitie,</hi>

                  <p>For as by it, and by it alone wee haue acceſſe to God, and truſt in his promiſes, without all wauering embracing the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Chriſts death and paſſion, which is the chiefe dutie of faith, ſo alſo where it lacketh roote in the good ground of godly hearts, it bringeth out, &amp; breaketh foorth
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:6446:70"/>into other frutes. And thoſe of ſundry ſorts to the vſe of men according to the diuerſe duties of diſcretion and charitie. But ſtill before God in the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of iuſtifying, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Paul diſputeth moſt, faith alone doth al, or rather receaueth all of God that doeth all. In other reſpects ſhe neuer is without her traine, and as the eye and only the eye in beholding the ſerpent in the wildernes, recouered the children of Iſraell, and yet their eyes were not without the reſt of the parts of their faces, &amp; their eyes ſerued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, for directing their feet otherwiſe, ſo the onely eye of faith, or onely faith as the eye of the ſoul beholdeth Chriſt of whom the ſerpent was but a figure, &amp; therby on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him are we ſaued, yet although in this regard alone it doth the deede, yet is it not alone, but continually accompanied with godlineſſe, &amp; all good woorks, in ſo much that where we finde not good works, it is bootleſſe to ſeeke for faith, for faith wil no where lodge or liue without works: the mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther cannot be without her daughers. If you kill the children, you kill the parent to. So that chaſe away works, &amp; faith will not tary after. If a man wil ſay, he retaineth her, &amp; retaineth not her retinew, well may he
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:6446:70"/>ſay ſo, but in ſooth &amp; veritie, in ſteede of a iuſtifying faith he laieth hold on an vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable deueliſh faith, a dead faith, a verbal faith, a ſhadow of faith, a faith which he ſo calleth, yet is not faith at all, neither hath it any affinity with the iuſtifying faith, which iuſtifieth alone, yet is not alone, as hath bene declared in manie wordes and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilie in mo then was needefull, but onely for the ſimpler ſort.</p>
                  <p>As there is a double taking of this word faith, either true or verball, ſo alſo is there a diuerſe acception of this worde <hi>iuſtifying,</hi> either for a beleeuing &amp; an apprehending the iuſtice of Chriſt imputed, or for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration that we are ſuch perſons to the opinion of others by iuſt liuing, which is a iuſtification before men. Of the former meaning Sainct Paul doth argue, the later ſence S. Iames forceth and ſtandeth moſt vpon. For ſaith he, <hi>I am a man (and not God) that ſeeth the heart.</hi> I am but man <hi>ſhew me thy faith &amp;c.</hi> So that theſe Apoſtles, Paule and Iames, albeit they vſe the ſame tearmes, both of faith and iuſtifying, yet becauſe they treating in deede thinges diuerſe, they can not be ſayde, to varie, when as they ſpeake of ſundrie matters,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:6446:71"/>and not both ſpeciallie of one, and the ſame thing, though ſeeming ſo in tearmes. For Sainct Paule treateth of one faith, &amp; S. Iames of an other: S. Paul of one iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sainct Iames of an other. Sainct Paul vpon a certaine doctrine, and Sainct Iames vppon a ſuppoſition.</p>
                  <p>If wee looke to heauen, faith onely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth thether, or rather grace deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto faith in true maner of ſpeaking. Workes are left below, who onely iuſtifie before men in earth. For otherwiſe men can not tell who is iuſtified, and who not, but by workes. But as onelie works do iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie here, ſo no doubt doth onely fayth there in reſpect of heauen.</p>

Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham beleeued God, and it was <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> vnto him for righteouſneſſe. (that is) he was iuſtified before God by faith. And then in offring his ſonne was he called the friend of God, and ſo iuſtified, called, and pronounced ſo. And ſo was his iuſtice tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly completed, and his faith in proofe perfited and allowed of. In the former of imputation of righteouſneſſe, Paule and Iames in expreſſe wordes, both agree. In
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:6446:71"/>the latter they diſagree not. For Paule ſpeaketh not thereof, but onelie Iames, who vppon great occaſions preſſeth the neceſſarie ſequeles of a true faith, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification to enſue, before men, ſtraight vppon a iuſtification praecedent beefore God. Wherupon as it were word for word, and in ſence he reaſoneth thus: If thine offences were pardoned in Chriſt, thie ſinnes remitted, and Chriſtes righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe imputed: that is, weareſt thou iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by fayth before God, it would follow neceſſarilie, that thy fayth would ſhewe it ſelfe, and thy deedes without, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what thou art within, and therebie ſhouldeſt thou be reputed a iuſt man, and ſo be iuſtified before men alſo. But hee that wanteth the neceſſarie conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſuch a cauſe, maie it not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that hee wanteth the cauſe it ſelfe?</p>
                  <p>In the Goſpell there were that boaſted of the line and race of Abraham. But the children of Abraham, that are in deede his children are a poſteritie according to faith, and not after the fleſh.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9</note> Wherefore ſaith our Sauiour vnto them. If ye were the children of Abraham by fayth, ye would do the workes of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Abraham did.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:6446:72"/>No workers, ergo no faithful childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his for all their vaunting. For though workes made them not his children, but faith, yet where ſuch works lacked, Chriſt therupon reaſoneth the wanting of faith it ſelfe. And it is true both in the nature of the thinges, and in the iudgement of the world. Yet all this doeth not diſproue, that faith alone doth iuſtifie before God, nether doth it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that workes do otherwiſe iuſtifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; by the neceſſity of due conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to inſue. Works haue their vſes, though not that vſe: one key wil not ſerue for euerie lock. They ſhew our faith to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they ar no parts of faith to make it vp, they are good duties that follow of faith, and ſo they iuſtifie &amp; no otherwiſe, in the eyes of men the behoulders. I am ouer long herin.</p>
                  <p>Touching the other example of Rahab the harlot: what were her works? ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; preſerued Ioſues meſſengers: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was ſhe iuſtified, that is ſo reputed in the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p. This one fact could not make her iuſt. But being iuſtified no doubt before by beleeuing in God, opportunitie ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge well, ſhee declared what ſhe was in giuinge ſuch entertainement to the Lords ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Which ſtorie well ſheweth,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:6446:72"/>that God hath his where a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would litle thinke, euen in that curſed city. Let no man deſpaire. Rahab an inhabitante of wicked Iericho, and ſhe ſometime an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot is accepted, but ſee withall ſhe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth her former life, and of an harlot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the hoſteſſe of Gods ſeruants. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in I note: an harlot was far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meriting &amp; therefore as afterwardes her good workes are recorded, ſo yet is not her former fault omitted, both to ſhew what ſhe obtained firſt by fauour and pardon of her fault, and then in dutie what ſhee did is ſpoken of, wherby ſhe became knowen to the Lords people, and this was her iuſtification en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing vpon a beleefe that went in fauour before. Wherby it appeared how S. Iames in theſe examples forced the vſe of good workes not to iuſtifie before God, but in ſeruice, dutie, and opinion of and to men.</p>
                  <p>Greater amplificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may be brought, by the skilfull in theſe caſes, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. In effect, this is all that either the Apoſtle meaneth, or I can ſay vpon his meaning: &amp; ſo much is plainly meant, that though in ſome functions they may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly occupied, yet true faith, and good workes euer meete togeather, and ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:6446:73"/>reſt in the iuſtified man.</p>
                  <p>But maruelous are the aduerſaries in their conceits.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rhem. not.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13</note> For they imagine a faithfull man to be without all faithfull and good dealing, as if they coulde finde vs out great ſprings without the iſſue of many waters, or much water without any moiſture, or a burning fire without his heat. We may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhe matters in their natures by tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, although we find them not ſundred in the perſons in whom we find them. And we do vſually diſtinguiſh faith and works, but in the faithfull they are neuer found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: &amp; therefore we do not ſeparate them there. So that contrary to that, which ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we are charged withall, we euer ſet forth a faith adorned with vertues, and not make a naked faith ſtript out of her attire, &amp; ſtill we tell them faith neither is nor can be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d alone in the man iuſtified, as hath bene proued at large, in the examination of the place of Iames.</p>

Paul to the Corinth. in whom ſay they, faith is ſeuered from loue, and if from loue, then from all good works, true, if fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loue. For all good works are ſummarily compre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:6446:73"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in loue, which therfore is ſaid to be the fulfilling of the lawe, becauſe it is of a greater ſpan, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining the works both of the firſt and ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d table in louing God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue al things, &amp; our neighbour as our ſelf. Then if faith be ſeparated from loue, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from other works. Now that from loue it may be ſeuered, S. Paul ſpeaketh ſay they in his owne perſon: If I had all faith, and had not loue, &amp;c. ergo all faith may be had without loue.</p>
                  <p>S. Paul as he had faith, ſo was he not void of loue, whoſe loue was ſo great that he had care of all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,<note place="margin">

And herein many iudge that S.

But if this be the ſenſe, then doth it not import that the iuſtifying faith may lacke loue, but the miraculous faith, if yet it proue ſo much. Whether S. Paul meane a miraculous faith, or no, or whether a miraculous faith (let it be a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:6446:74"/>faith) can be ſeuered from the iuſtifying or no, I will not greatlie ſtriue. There is no edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in multiplying of imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

But S. Paule doth no where diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne them, but concluding the praiſes of loue, ſaith: there are three that remaine

Of all theſe the laſt is the greateſt, what? in iuſtifying? no. S. Paul debateth the matter to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie euerie where.

For when knowledge ſhall ceaſe, &amp; faith ſhall haue his date, and hope ſhalbe expired in the leaſe of this life, in the life to come remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth loue. And this is all that the Apoſtle meaneth, which neither confuteth the <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donnes</hi> of faith in her proper office of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, neither yet doth it any way co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme, that in other reſpectes ſhe can be alone in the man iuſtified.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>You reply,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 10.1</note> that all this aſſurance is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and condicionall, generall &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not ſure in particuler,<note place="margin">2</note> condicionall, &amp; therefore vncertaine depending vpon a doubtful expectation. I wil aunſwer both theſe cauils.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, as for generall ſuppoſels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their truth in particulars it is a meere toye in Philoſophie, and in Diuinitie it hath no ſence. For God doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb facs="tcp:6446:79"/>generally at auentures, katch who catch can, but directly &amp; in ſpeciall to all that receaue.</p>
                  <p>As ſoundes &amp; colours are open abroad in the aire, and yet in the ſences of hearing and ſeeing are made particular, and in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall both harde, and ſeene, ſo Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are vttered generally to all, but of the receauers, and beleeuers are they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly apprehended, or elſe not apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded at all. For generall apprehenſions are dreames &amp; no apprehending. If I beleeue remiſſion of ſins in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon generality &amp; no more, without ſpecial applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to my ſelf, what availeth that: Wherefore Chriſt ſaith: <hi>My ſonne haue a confidence: thy ſins are forgiuen thee.</hi> Hold faſt that,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.2.</note> for there is the comfort, and there ariſeth the certainty of faith and hope. And generall promiſes why are they made to all, but to the end they may be beleeued of euery one in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall?</p>
                  <p>If a mortal Prince vnder ſeale &amp; writing proclaime a generall pardon, there is no ſubiect that hath offended, but wold craue a particularitie in the generall, litle doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therof for the ſafty of himſelfe &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his offence: or were he wiſe, or in his

If thou be a ſcholler, I ſay to thee in thine own tearmes, when thou heareſt a generall Maior out of the worde of God, examine whether thou canſt finde the minor in thine own conſcience, and then doubt not, but the concluſion will follow neceſſarily vpon thine owne ſelfe. As for example for the ſimplers ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie: all beleeuers ſhall be ſaued: art thou a beleeuer? then conclude, thou ſhalt be ſaued.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other cauill was, that theſe promiſes were made vnder co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition &amp; in ſome meaning, your ſaying is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe. For the promiſes are made with condicion, <hi>If we beleeue,</hi> and if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not, be the promiſes neuer ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, yet the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Common Philoſophie taught the Heathen that principle, Eternall thinges ſuffer not contrarie paſſions. And ſhall Chriſtians imagine the Eternall God to bee ſubiecte to varieties, that ſtand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the fickleneſſe of vncertaine condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Heauen and earth ſhall paſſe, but neither God nor his worde, which is as firme as is him ſelfe ſhall paſſe. And how then ſayeth Maiſter Stapleton, Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are ſo condicionall, as that they maie bee vncertayne in reſpecte of God that promiſeth? And doeth he not know but thus much, that the greateſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the faithfull and faithleſſe man conſiſteth herein, that the godly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receaued of God any promiſe, are thereby reſolued, that comming he will come, &amp; ſhew his ſauing health in time co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:6446:81"/>wicked, are not ſo ſatisfied, and therefore when God ſpeaketh, ſomtimes they look to the right hande, ſomtimes on the lefte, ſometimes before, and ſometimes behind, ſomtimes into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, when they ſhold onelie and ſtedfaſtlie direct theyr hope and faith to God alone that will not faile?<note place="margin">

For might we perceaue neare at hand the way, and the meanes, then were there no triall of Faith, nor exerciſe of hope. For faith and hope are of thinges that are not ſeene. But when the matter paſſeth our reache, and we iudge it not poſſible, then is God glorified, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</p>
                  <p>And to this end, concerning your exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>VVhen this will not ſerue,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4</note> you bring foorth the example of Paule, whome you ſaie doubted and durſt not iudge himſelfe.

There were amongſt the Corinthians, that by odious and friuolouſe compariſons fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſlie held ſome with ſome, ſome with others, as if Chriſt were deuided in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of his ſeruauntes, and of Paule a preciouſe veſſel of chiefe choiſe, they eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med leſſe then either his office required, or was expedient for their ſaluation. VVhom Paule in effect ſchooleth on this wiſe: for mine own part as I am not altogether care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſo yet I paſſe not greatly to be iudged of you. Nay I iudge not my ſelf much leſſe ſhould you. And albeit I know nothing by

Now I aske wherin and why Paule would not iudge him ſelfe? He ſpeketh of his fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and therein to claime that which ſome of them gaue to ſome that deſerued happilie litle or leſſe then he, in ſuch ſort &amp; in ſo high a degree, he told them flat, albeit he were better then the beſt, and not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him ſelfe of default in this behalfe, yet he would not iudge nor iuſtifie him ſelfe. VVhy? for iudgement belongeth to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon, and to an other time, and not to be vſurped either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or of him, by the way of deciding definitiuely like a iudge. But God whoſe waies are not mans waies, and who ſeeth farther into man, then man into him ſelfe, in that day ſhall lighten things, that were hid in darkneſſe, &amp; make the councels of hearts manifeſt, <hi>And then ſhall euery man haue praiſe of God:</hi> which laſt words of praiſe to be had then, ar no trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling words of a doutfull minde, but a ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full good remembrance full of comfort, &amp;

Perhaps ſo, and yet no man knoweth what was in Paule, but the ſpirit of Paule that was in him. We denie not but that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of faiths aſſurance may be variable, not onely in diuerſe men, but in one &amp; the ſame man at diuers times. Yet more or leſſe in a degre doth not aboliſh the nature of faith, nor quite extinguiſh her properneceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſarie qualities, wherof aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is the chief. Which though it be eclipſed as it were by an interpoſition, ſometimes of groſſe and heauie fleſh, which the beſt carie about with them, yet in the end faith wil returne to her courſe, ſhewe her face, and breake out againe, neither can ſhe be euer fruſtrat of the effect of aſſurance.

                  <p>As the wicked may feele ſome ioye a while, that they may haue a greater feeling of ſorrowe in the end: ſo ſometimes the

And this is a ſure doctrine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be embraced of all, that albeit wee ſtumble, yet he will not ſuffer his to fall, or if to fall, not finallie to fall awaye, if God wound he will heale, if he kill, he will reuiue, and if he breake downe the walles of thy faith, that they ſeme to ſhake and totter, and fall, doubt not, he wil build them vp, he wil turne all to the good of his children, and if he darken thine eye, that is fixed vpon him ſelfe, be aſſured he will not do it out, neither will he take his holie ſpirit from the holy and faithfull, as he did the Spirit of the Regiment and fortitude from Saule. No, though he bring thee to hell, he will not leaue thee there. Why then? What if faith be much aſſaulted, and ſometimes brought into narrower ſtraightes then ſome, God knoweth beſt howe long it is beſt to hold his own vppon the rack, &amp; it is the teachers dutie, and it is Sainct Paules endeuour thereby to giue out doctrine of comfort, and not therebie to empaire the faithfull mans aſſurance as Pigghius doth.</p>

This is ſtraunge and inopinable. For did not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:6446:86"/>Paule know him ſelfe better, then he knew others, or if he did (as do doubt he did) did not his greater knowledg therin aſſure him ſelfe more of him ſelfe then of others.<note place="margin">Rhem. not. Rom. <hi>8.38</hi>

                     </note> For that this aſſurance was not a probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but a certaintie, and a confidence, which is more. But let vs rather reaſon the matter.

                  <p>Yong ſcholers are taught and it is true, that there are probabilities of ſundry ſorts, either wherunto a man may anſwer indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentlie yea or no, becauſe of the vnapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent notice of them, for they may be or theye may not be, and whether parte a man holdeth, it ſkilleth litle. For both parts maye be mainetayned with like reaſons. If they meane ſuch a probabilitie to be in Sainct Paule, he that defied boeth high and lowe, will little paſſe for ſuch drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming coniecturals, in reſpect of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the marke that he ſhotte at, or of the infallible means to attaine theru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to.</p>

                  <p>As for the old obiection out of the book of the Preacher,<note place="margin">

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:6446:88"/>and ſauing that hee wanteth the oyle of truth, he hath ſet a fewe freſh colours ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then euer yet I could ſet eye on in anie other, as I well remember, facing vs out that Salomon firſt putteth it downe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie, that there is no certaintie, and that al things are vncertain, &amp; that man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not whether he bee in caſe of loue or hatred. And wheras we ſhewe out of the text, that it is ment that there is no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie touching the euent of our affaires, he telleth vs that that is a ſeconde ſayinge, and a particuler confirmation, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of the former generall vnto ſuch caſualtyes as maye beefall a man either in this life, or in the kinde of his death. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine where wee euidentlye proue that a man maye aſſure him ſelfe of the hatred of God (who hateth ſinners) if he be a ſinner. And therefore where Salomon ſayeth a man knoweth not whether he be hated or no, he reſpecteth neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie not the ſence and touch of an inwarde conſcience, either of the loue of God, if he be faythfull, or of his hatred, if he be ſinnefull, and faythleſſe, Maiſter Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton ſayeth, the certaynetie of loue, and hatred are not a like, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:6446:88"/>that there is mention made of hatred, becauſe when a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beginneth to queſtio whether he be to be beleeued ſtraight waie in that verie moment, he miſdee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth whether he be not worthy of hatred alſo.</p>
                  <p>Vnto all this I aunſwer brieflie. But in the meane ſeaſon well we perceiue that, (as the wiſeman ſayth) a dead flie maie marre the good ſmell of the ſweete oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo a curſed gloze may corrupt the faireſt text. But I anſwer and aske: are all thinges detained in an vncertainty? he that ſayth all, ſeemeth verily to excepte nothing, and nether can any thing be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, which is ſubiect to that all, which he meaneth that ſaith al. But that al things ſhould be vncertaine with euer (either in ſence, or in faith, whereof Chryſoſtom ſaith, though ſenſe may be deceaued,<note place="margin">Orat. <hi>9.</hi> in <hi>10.</hi> c. Heb.</note> yet can not faith) is farre from Solomons thoughtes in this place. So that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no abſolute generall ſaying, and then afterwarde commeth in with a particular matter of externall euentes, he proueth a generall vncertaintie thereof and in that kinde, and yeldeth the cauſe why, which muſt needes be as large as the effects, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:6446:89"/>the cauſe of like compaſſe with the effects, <hi>eo quod,</hi> becauſe all thinges fall out alike to the iuſt and vniuſt, to the good, and to the bad, &amp;c. And verely this is onely the wiſe mans intent to ſhewe the vanitie of mortal euents vnder the ſun, &amp; therwithal to teach me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to decide by the outward face of things concerning Gods fauor. For had he mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſpeake generally without exception of any thing, or ſpecially to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of faith, a particular alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or the like, had bene but a colde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or a ſlender proof. Wherfore (M. Stapl.) if you will argue an vncertainetie of faith, which we denie, and diſproue the certainety there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which we affirme, you muſt ſhewe an vncertaintie to be in God the promiſer, or in the holy Ghoſt the confirmer, or in the like groundes, whereupon we build, and not diſpute of common euents, which fall out indifferently to the one, and the other, either good or bad, and ſometimes in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier ſort, as it may ſeeme to the godly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the wicked man. For among the good the beſt, or among the beſt, the very beſt: or among the bad the better, and the leſſe bad may be in the ſame caſe outwardly, as
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:6446:89"/>may be the worſt. Whereof onely, Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon treateth, and not in generall againſt al knowledg. For if he meane that nothing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be known, how knew he that he knew nothing? But we know of Solomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s know ledge the ſcriptures ſpeake much, &amp; that of M. Stapletons vncertainty in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and no aſſurance in faith, they are altogeather ſilent, and ſpeake nothing at all, no more then they do of that which he telleth vs verie impertinentlie to the text in Solomon, that when a man examineth his ſtate, whether he be in the loue of God immediatly euer the doubt of hatred com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth alwayes to minde. What fraile fleſh will doe, is not our queſtion. What faith ought to do is that, which we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend for. But if fleſh doubt, yet muſt faith reſolue all doubt. Thy fleſh will ſuggeſt &amp; bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy memorie thy many ſinnes, but inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly thy faith muſt recorde the mercies of God, that are more in number, &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in value, and moſt certaine to this vſe to pardon and remit ſinnes.

                  <p>Out of this ſtory ſundry inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may be gathered. Firſt that as the oxe doth eat vppe the thiſtle, ſo may the axe ouerthrow the oke. i. as the poore ſinfull people ſhall ſurely be puniſhed, ſo the vnſanctified mightie man ſhall not euer eſcape.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:6446:94"/>&amp; therby, by this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to declare, not that the hearines of our apparell, becauſe happily therwas ſome ſinguler thing in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias attire, as likwiſe in Iohn Bapt. apparel, which was an other Elias, but that our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire &amp; apparell in moſt modeſt maner ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally be ſeemely, &amp; that all our behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our be ſuch either in gate, words, or deeds, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> report is made therof, a man may ſtraight auouch, verily there is a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>There is no doubt, but diſſimulation is ſpun now adayes of ſo fine a thread, that it is hard to diſcerne who is who.

                     <note place="margin">The Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt. The Papiſt</note>There are three eſpecial enemies of this word of God, and therfore enemies to the rule of goodneſſe, and to the leuell of all ſanctimonie. The firſt is the fantaſticall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſt, that dreameth of Reuelations: the ſecond is the wilfull Atheiſt, that thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the worde of God to be to trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, it hindreth his fancies, it forbiddeth his delightes, and ſtoppeth all the bathes of his vaine pleaſure, it talketh to much of ſanctification. The third enemie is the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Papiſt ſubtiller then all the beaſts of the earth beſide, he knoweth his coine is adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, and therefore he feareth the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, his chaffe wolde not be winnowed. And no maruaile. For wold falſe prophets be ſifted, or vaine ſpirites be brought to their triall? Wherefore the man of ſinne goeth about to diſſwade me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from hearing,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:6446:97"/>and reading this worke of God, and in ſteede of the waters of the Scriptures they haue digged vp puddles of wilworſhiping and ſuch like mud, fitter for the horſe and camel, then for Chriſtian ſouls: &amp; in roome of the light of Gods word they haue ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted falſe &amp; mocklights of their owne, in place of virgin wax, they haue giuen vs tallow, in roome of a candle, they haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vs a ſnuffe, &amp; the candle of the Lords word, they haue detained, vnder a bed or a buſhell, that the faithfull men might neuer knowe what they did, nor diſcerne what they beleeued. As if to beleue well, were to beleue a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knew not what, or to liue wel, were to liue in ignorance, and to do the works of darkneſſe. And yet they pretend great reaſon for all this, and ſo did he, that ſaid of one that could be mad with reaſon. I can not debate the controuerſie, I ſhall but touch a reaſon or two. The worde is vncertaine, the worde is obſcure, ergo not to be read and heard abſolutely of all, &amp;c. Vncertaine? I know not what is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, if this be not. Where &amp; in what place dare they thus ſpeake? in the Church of God? before whome? before the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Saintes? The word is as a candle,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:6446:97"/>which giueth light both to the houſe, and ſheweth withall what it ſelfe is, &amp; is it then vncertaine? but it is obſcure. So you ſaie. We aske to whom? we aunſwere to them, that periſh. It is harder ſomwhere then in ſome, to ſtir vp thine attention, &amp; therfore it is commaunded, Search the Scriptur, dig for wiſedome, ſeek for knowledge as after ſiluer and gold. Be it that it be obſcure. Yet as that ſaying in great part is moſt falſe, ſo is the reaſon moſt faultie. The candle bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth dimme, therfore toppe it. It is a good argument. There is a knotte in the weeke, therfore open it, that the light may haue eaſier entrance. It is a fit reaſon. But the candle burneth obſcurely, therefore put it out, or throw it away, or anie ſuch like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is ſtarke naught. Yea the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the Scripture is, the more it muſt be laboured, &amp; the more inceſſantlie ſtudied, becauſe it is that, wherein we knowe is life euerlaſting, and the way of life which is ſanctification.</p>
                  <p>To let go them that will not heare vs, ſeeke after this waye, there are of thoſe, that ſeeke ſundrie ſortes. Some ſeeke on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to the end they maie be knowen, to be verie ſkilfull men in good thinges:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:6446:98"/>this is an ambitiouſe vanitie, ſome only to know: this is fond curioſitie, ſome to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them ſelues: this is true wiſedome, and ſome to edifie others, and this is perfit charitie. The two former ſorts are naught, the two later holy and good. For true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and perfit holineſſe, is made neither of bragging wordes or peeuiſh fancies: but this is true deuotion, to viſit the ſicke, the widow, the fatherleſſe, &amp; to keepe a mans ſelfe blameles from the ſoile of the world. He that neuer ſaw hony may talke &amp; think how ſweete a thing it is: but he that taſteth therof, can better tell what a gratious taſt it hath in deede.</p>
                  <p>Again there ar others that though they cared litle for ſeeking them ſelues, yet are they content to let others alone with ſuch matters. But all their care is as they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried awaye with ſome conceit or other. They riſe vp early in the morning, and go to bed late, and eate their bread in great care to compaſſe purpoſes. But alas what meane they? Suppoſe thou be a Monarch, a noble, a marchant man, or what thou wilt, if thou gaine all, and loſe a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and thereby thy ſoule, thy loſſe is greater, then thy gaine. Thou art a iollie

One ſanctified ſoule then will be more worth, then innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinners. O Lorde ſanctifie them and vs with a liuely vnderſtanding of thy trueth. Thy word is the truth, teach vs, O Lorde, good wayes therin, that we may know &amp; do thy will.</p>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:6446:99"/>might be concealed from them: that it might not be told to the enemies of Saul, and of God. With like affection it is to be deſired, that ether there wer no Sauls at al, or that they might die either obſcurely, or liue otherwiſe then to the ſlaunder of the profeſſion they ſeeme to be of, but in truth are not. They that haue dwelt or dwell in Gath, &amp; Aſkalon, in Louain, Doway, Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, or Rhemes, the enemies of vs, of our Land, and of our God, wilbe glad to hear that he which is reckoned a iuſtified man by faith, were yet a prophane perſon like Eſau in the race of his life. The ſtreame of ſinne is ſtrong, and carieth the world with it, but he that thinketh he ſtandeth, let him take heede he fall not. If a piller fall, the houſe is in daunger, if a mightie tree fall, it bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth downe manie bowes and ſprigges with it. O, what a ſhame were it for anie that haue begun in the ſpirit to ende in the fleſh, to reioyce in the light and afterward to loue darknes more then light, to receiue as it were a portion of faith, and then to miſpend it? The children of the vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed will make great triumphes, when they ſhall heare hereof, ſuppoſing they haue gayned much, when they can finde

Wherefore let euerie man looke to his wayes, &amp; ſtand to his watch, that he offend not God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he giue place to Sathan, cauſe, of ioy to the aduerſarie, or of griefe to the godly, that he defile not him ſelfe, driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſpirit, receaue the word in vaine, ſtayne his profeſſion, and that he be not like the Aſſe and Mule, that carieth on his backe, wheate, or breade, or wine, and yet eateth onelie chaffe, and drinketh nothing but water. To carie the name of a Chriſtian is little woorth, except you feede on the properties of Chriſtianity, &amp; expreſſe them in a good life. For not to talke of Chriſt, but to liue in Chriſt, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede to be a Chriſtian, vnto whom it may &amp; ſhold be ſaid, as it was vnto Mary: thou ſhalt beare a ſonne, and thou ſhalt call his name Ieſus.

                  <p>For this, that Moſes and Elias were diſcerned the text ſetteth down, howe they were diſcerned it ſetteth not downe. A ſimple aunſwer is eaſieſt and trueſt as I take it. God who made the apparition to Peter and Iohn, gaue vnto Peter and Iohn the knowledge to diſcerne who they were that appeared, whether he will giue them the like knowledge in the life to come becauſe the ſcripture is ſilent, I dare not definitiuely ſay or argue to or fro.</p>
                  <p>Farther it is reaſoned: Adam in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie ſtraight way, notwithſtanding he were aſleepe, when Eué was taken out of his ſide, yet he knew, who Eué was: ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably, when this corruption ſhall put on incorruption, when ſinnefulnes ſhal cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge for innocency, like to or elſe more perfitte then Adams in Paradiſe, when our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:6446:107"/>in part ſhall be made perfit, and our charity intended to an higher degree and exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to more in number, then we may, if know the things that we knewe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, much more know the things, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognize the perſons we knew once.</p>
                  <p>I will not diſpute againſt this opinion, much, for peraduenture it may be true.</p>
                  <p>Farther it is reaſoned, that if the damned ſpirite of the richman in hell, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the great diſtance &amp; chaos betwixt, could diſcerne Lazarus &amp; Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the ſoules of the iuſt and perfit me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal much more ſee with a clearer eye the ſociety of all, but eſpecially certaine in the cytie of the Saincts.</p>
                  <p>I will not anſwer this to be parabolical, &amp; that euery part of a parable doth not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer proue euery matter, that it may be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto. For it may be that this very part thus vrged, is not of a thing altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
                  <p>But that which I ſhall ſhortly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by occaſion of the queſtion moued, is moſt true, and much to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>Firſt it is true that death is a paſſage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a better life to all that beleue, a doore, &amp; entrance into heauen, a redy meanes to be
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:6446:108"/>with Chriſt, and not where Chriſt is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (for Chriſt according to his Godhead is excluded no place) but with Chriſt, and in Paradiſe are they, who die a corporall death, but yet liue vnto Chriſt. And then this being throughly conſidered it doth lenifie ſuch natural paſſions as are incide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the ſonnes of Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it maketh the bitter cup to haue a ſweete taſt, it breedeth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be diſſolued, and a longing to be at our long and laſt home. For the things here are nothing to the thinges there: yet are we hardly induced to leaue them, and herein they ſerue &amp; loue vs moſt, and we them.</p>
                  <p>But let vs conſider, when we die, we depart from the world, and therefore from worldly affections alſo we ſhould depart, and betake our ſelues wholly to a better habitation, and vtterly to haue nothing to do, with the things that are done vnder the ſunne after the diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our houſe and temporalities, as Eſaie exhorted the king.</p>
                  <p>A wet eye and an affectionate minde doth neither diſcerne aright, nor iudge vprightly in this caſe, and when we ſhould be rauiſhed with the loue of his face, to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:6446:108"/>whom we go, we looke backward, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall ſee the faces of our old frinds any more.</p>
                  <p>In the reſurrection they neither marry nor are maried, mariage is the neereſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction amongeſt men. But then the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; wife ſhalbe ſwalowed vp as it were a candle put out at the riſing of the Sunne. Therefore the affections toward father and mother, children and kinred, of conſanguinitie and blood of affinitie or amity which are leſſe, ſhal alſo ceaſe then. For they will either hinder ſomewhat, or doe much hurte in the quietnes of our paſſage.</p>
                  <p>I reade of one Rotholdus (of whome Sigibert doth write) a man of name, and a Duke, when he ſhoulde be baptiſed, he would knowe whether there were moe in heauen or in hell, and what acquaintance he had in either place, was not this a great folly?</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond booke of Samuel Dauid maketh offer to an old aged man Barzelai,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.</note> that elſwhen, had ſhewed him kindnes, &amp; that now God had bleſſed Dauid, and had brought him to the kingdome, he woulde requite the old man, and offered him that
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:6446:109"/>he ſhould goe with him, &amp; be in his court at Ieruſalem. But Barzelay on the other ſide maketh a contrarie requeſt vnto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, that he may returne to Gilead, and dy in his own countrie, and be buried in the graues of his aunceſtors, and as for anie pleaſure that he could take in the kings pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, he ſaid he was ouerſpent and worne, his ſenſe of taſting was gone, &amp; ſo of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, the voyce of the ſingers and the court muſicke did not affect the old man.</p>
                  <p>In the ſtorie we ſee a contentation in the aged man, and alſo a loue to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try whereby he preferred Gilead before Ieruſalem. I do not altogeather diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend euery point in his affection. But, by application, if I may ſpeake, there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer many Barzelaies now a dayes both in their liues, and in their deathes. They are ſo long time accuſtomed to the worſe, that they diſdaine the better, they cannot taſt the truth, they will not heare the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke of the charmer, charme he neuer ſo cunningly. They began in ſuperſtition, they haue long continued in error, and they will needes be buried in the idolatrie of their forefathers, and they will go whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they thinke they haue moſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:6446:109"/>But true religion goeth neither by the moſt, nor by thoſe that ſeeme to be moſt neere a man commonly.</p>
                  <p>In our life, the worde is our direction, the ſpirit our guide. In our death we muſt, as we reſigne our bodyly ſubſtance vnto godly vſes, and our bodies for a time, into the boſome of the earth, ſo without more adoe, &amp; without forecaſting of doubts, or ſcruples, of curious, fancifull or affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat queſtioning muſt we wholy yeeld vp our ſoules vnto God our father a ſafe kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of them vnto the gloriouſe reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſt Ieſu, to whom with the holy ſpirite three perſons, and one euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuing God be euerlaſting praiſe, Amen.</p>
